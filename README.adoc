== Caveats

This is not a proper implementation. Here is a list of some elements that could be improved (non exhaustive list):

- No database connection pool
- Optimistic locking not implemented
- No API documentation (eg OpenAPI)
- No unit test
- No production artifact (only dev is done)
- Deleting row should be logical. Right now, it is really deleted.
